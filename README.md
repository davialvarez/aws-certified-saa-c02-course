# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Basics

### VPC Considerations

- What **size** should the VPC be..
- Are there any Networks **we can't use** ...
- VPC's, Cloud, On-premises, Partners & Vendors
- Try to predict the **future**..
- VPC **Structure** - Tiers & Resiliency (Availability) Zones
- VPC minimum **/28** (16 IP), maximum **/16** (65456 IPs)
- **Avoid common ranges** - avoid future issues

### VPC Sizing

| VPC Size    | Netmask | Subnet Size | Hosts/Subnet | Subnets/VPC | Total IPs |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| Micro       | /24     | /27         | 27           | 8           | 216       |
| Small       | /21     | /24         | 251          | 8           | 2008      |
| Medium      | /19     | /22         | 1019         | 8           | 8152      |
| Large       | /18     | /21         | 2043         | 8           | 16344     |
| Extra Large | /16     | /20         | 4091         | 16          | 65456     |

- How many **subnets** will you need?
- How many **IPs total**? How many **per subnet**?
